    "You must use Jupyter notebook to complete homework 2 and submit it as a .ipynb file on Blackboard. This is to have you practice writing notebooks using markdown and code. For a tutorial on markdown, see: https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet. If you use code to solve for the final answer, please give your answer as part of a print statement that explains what the number means. Example: `print('Probability that X=5 is', prob)`. See these tutorials for how to nicely format output: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-string-formatters-in-python-3 and https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/string/format.\n"

Then describe one example in your life or in your future career in which this distribution may be used to model an uncertainty. (If you can't find an example, choose another distribution.) Illustrate each application using reasonable parameters you choose, and plot the PMF or PDF of the distribution as well as a histogram of 100 samples. Write one sentence to summarize an insight from looking at the histogram or the PMF/PDF that may be helpful for the application you chose."
