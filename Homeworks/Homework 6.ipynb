    "\n",
    "Let decision variables $X$ and $Y$ denote the amount of product X and product Y to use respective. The linear program is\n",

    "Notice that the variables $X$ and $Y$ are in a special font denoting mathematical variables. Moreover, notice that the linear program above is centered and aligned, both at the colons and at the signs ($\\le$ and $\\ge$).

    "As you can see, to render a mathematical expression nicely, we enclose it using dollar signs. So the expression X>0, becomes $X>0$. A single dollar sign is for mathematical expressions inline, and double dollar signs are for a standalone mathematical expressions in its own line (See code by double clicking this cell). $$X>=0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the linear program aligned, we not only use the double dollar signs, but also use the `\\begin{aligned} \\end{aligned}` commands. (Double click the linear program above to see the code.) Within the alignment block:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `\\text{ }` is for displaying the enclosed string as plain text, without the mathematical rendering.\n",
    "- `&` is for alignment. The convention is right align before the first `&`, then left align between the first and second `&` of each line, then right align again between the second and third `&` and so on. Hence, to make it right aligned both before and after the colon, we use a double `&&` after the `\\text{}`. If this is confusing, you can simply copy this convention for this homework (`&&` after the explanation of constraint, and `&` before the sign). \n",
    "- `\\\\` is for creating a new line. Notice that we end the line early using `\\\\` for \"subject to\" and \"maximize\".\n",
    "- `\\le` (less than or equal to) is for $\\le$, and `\\ge` (greater than or equal to) is for $\\ge$. This looks better than $<=$ and $>=$.\n",

    "This notation is called LaTex, and is the standard for people in technical fields to display math. Make sure that you close any braces you begin and put the alignment characters `&` and newlines `\\\\` at the right places, or the math may not render.

    "When formulating the linear program in part a), **instead of manually defining each variable as in the hint in the book, you should practice using indexing notation**, which also saves you effort on manual input and makes your formulation easily generalizable to larger data sets. You should use the following notation in your formulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $I=\\{A,B,C\\}$ represents the set of plants;\n",
    "- $J=\\{O,T,H,D\\}$ represent the set of manufacturers. \n",
    "- Let your decision variables be $x_{ij}$, which is the amount shipped from plant $i \\in I$ to manufacturer $j \\in J$. (For example $x_{AO}$ is the amount shipped from Arlington to Onyx. $\\sum_{j\\in J} x_{Aj}$ is the total amount produced from Arlington. $\\sum_{i \\in I} x_{iO}$ is the total amount shipped to Onyx.)\n",
    "- For each plant $i \\in I$, the production cost is $p_i$ and the monthly capacity is $q_i$. (For example, $p_A=17$ and $q_A=800$.)\n",
    "- For each manufactuer $j \\in J$, the demand of motors per month is given by $d_j$. (For example, $d_O=300$, $d_T=500$.) \n",
    "- For each plant $i\\in I$ and each manufacturer $j\\in J$, the transportation cost from plant $i$ to manufactuer $j$ can be indexed by $c_{ij}$. (For example using the data from the table associated with the question, $c_{AO}=3$, $c_{BT}=4$.)\n",
    "\n",
    "To write a indexed variable in Latex, you can use `c_{ij}` for $c_{ij}$ (make sure to enclose it either in single dollar sign for in-line math or double-dollar sign for stand-alone math). To write summation, you can use the command `\\sum`, with underline and braces to indicate the set you are summing over. For example (double click the following expression to see the code), \n",
    "$$\\text{Total transportation cost} = \\sum_{i \\in I, j \\in J} c_{ij}x_{ij}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The above expression is equivalent to looping over both the set of plants $I$ and set of manufacturers $J$ and adding the term $c_{ij} x_{ij}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The summation notation helps you express many constraints at once. For example you can write the capacity constraint at all three plants using the equation\n",
    "$$ \\text{Respecting capacity:  } \\sum_{j \\in J} x_{ij} \\le q_i \\text{ for every plant $i \\in I$}.$$\n",
    "\n",
